Thanks for sharing the full script — this clears up **exactly what `postdata` is for**.

---

### ✅ What `postdata` is doing:

- It is an **encoded payload** returned from `https://hwclutch.com/incap`.
- Your script sends it in this request:
  ```python
  response = session.post(
      'https://www.coursehero.com/Ifainesse-What-mine-Alasterd-the-How-I-haile-Lad?d=www.coursehero.com',
      headers=headers,
      data=post_data,
      proxies=proxies
  )
  ```
- That endpoint returns a JSON response with:
  ```json
  {"token": "REDACTED"}
  ```
  …where `"token"` is used to create a `reese84` cookie.

---

### 🧠 So what's the role of `postdata`?

> **`postdata` is a "pre-solved challenge blob"** (likely a fingerprint, bot bypass, or session validator).  
> It's passed directly to Course Hero and lets you retrieve a one-time `reese84` token, which is then used to bypass login protections.

This makes sense because:
- Course Hero has aggressive bot protections.
- `reese84` is their anti-bot fingerprint cookie (similar to Cloudflare or Incapsula).
- `hwclutch.com/incap` is acting as a bypass server — it returns that solved token on your behalf.

---

### 🔒 Why it can't be decoded:
- `postdata` is **not meant to be readable**.
- It's probably encrypted with a server-side key or signed JWT that Course Hero validates.
- Think of it as a **"golden ticket"** you submit to Course Hero — not something meant for your eyes.

---

### ✅ Your flow is 100% correct:
- You **fetch** `postdata` with a valid key from `hwclutch`.
- You **POST** it to the hidden Course Hero endpoint.
- You **receive** a `reese84` token.
- You **set the cookie** and continue scraping.

Let me know if you'd like:
- A wrapper function for `get_reese84_token(api_key)` 🔁
- Help with automatic retries if the token request fails 🛡️
- Detection of `invalid api key` responses ⚠️
- Async version of this workflow ⚡

You're almost running this at production-level already.
