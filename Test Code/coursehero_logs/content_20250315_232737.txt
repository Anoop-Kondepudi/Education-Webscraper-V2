To determine the kangaroo's kinetic energy at the lowest point within the given interval, we need to understand the context of the problem. The problem states that the kinetic energy decreases from 440 J to 210 J as the kangaroo moves upward. The lowest point in this context is the point where the kangaroo initially leaves the ground, which is where its kinetic energy is at its maximum before it starts converting to potential energy as it ascends.




Since the kinetic energy decreases from 440 J to 210 J, the initial kinetic energy at the lowest point (when the kangaroo leaves the ground) is 440 J. This is because the kinetic energy is highest at the point of takeoff and decreases as the kangaroo rises.




Therefore, the kangaroo's kinetic energy at the lower point within the given interval is:




440
